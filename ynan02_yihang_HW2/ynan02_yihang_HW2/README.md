Practice how to create SVM and Softmax classifiers in Python
with NumPy package. You need to understand how SVM and Sofmax classifier works,
including back propagation and gradient decent is performed in order to complete this
homework successfully. The goals of this homework are:
- To understand the steps to train/test the classifier for image classification.
- To use the validation dataset for tune up hyper parameters.
- To implement and understand SVM classifier.
- To implement and understand Softmax classifier.

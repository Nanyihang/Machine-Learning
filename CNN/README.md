Practice how to create Convolutional Neural Network in
Python with TensorFlow and nGraph. nGraph is an open source C++ library, compiler and
runtime to accelerate deep learning workloads on CPU processors, such as Intel® Xeon®
(https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph).
You need to understand how CNN works, including back propagation and gradient
decent is performed in order to complete this homework successfully. The goals of this
homework are:
- Understand architecture of CNN and how to connect each layer together by using
TensorFlow and nGraph.
- Implement and understand CNN using TensorFlow and nGraph.
